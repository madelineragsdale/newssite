          <p>VIENNA — In the three years since the start of the Iran nuclear agreement, a cluster of buildings near the Austrian capital has served as an unblinking eye over Tehran’s most sensitive factories and research labs. But perhaps not for much longer.

			Every day, workers arrive at the United Nations nuclear agency here to monitor live video from inside Iran’s once-secret uranium enrichment plants, part of an unbroken stream of data delivered by cameras and other remote sensors installed as part of the 2015 accord. Each week, scientists in lab coats analyze dust samples collected from across Iran, looking for minute particles that could reveal possible cheating. </p>

        <div class="card-content">
          <p>Today, President Trump announced the United States would in effect be exiting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and is prepared to reimpose sanctions. This opens up a divide between the U.S. and the other negotiating partners (Britain, France, Germany) as well as Russia and China, which will remain part of the deal. He spoke in sweeping generalities (“disastrous,” “giant fiction”), and his complaints were misplaced. The reason it did not “bring peace,” it is fair to say, is because Trump never had a policy for addressing Iran’s nonnuclear conduct. From all appearances, he still does not. As stunning as it may seem, it does not appear the administration has planned out what happens next, precisely what its critics predicted.

			Brian Katulis of the Center for American Progress argues, “It will get rid of an imperfect but effective deal that constrained Iran’s actions. . . [but] weakens America’s position and leverage.” He contends, “Trump and [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu have a similar approach on Iran — heavy on rhetoric and bluster, but light on actual policies that shape the landscape to our countries’ advantage.” </p>

          <p>“Gotcha.”

That was Kellyanne Conway’s response to the New Yorker’s harrowing account of the abuse four women say they suffered from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned last night. Not horror, or fury or sympathy for the victims who came forward. A single, smug “gotcha” of sadistic triumph.

Conway wasn’t alone among Republicans in crowing over Schneiderman’s downfall. Donald Trump Jr. also did what he does best — act like a jerk on Twitter — resharing with almost palpable glee earlier missives from his father insulting the now-former top prosecutor. Their cause for celebration wasn’t only the wrenching out of a prominent thorn in the president’s side. It was what they saw as a platonic case of Democratic hypocrisy: Progressives proclaim their devotion to the feminist future and #MeToo moment publicly, while privately many are as monstrous as the Republican politicians who have seen their misdeeds exposed over the past several months.</p>
